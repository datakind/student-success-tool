    Compute *non* graduation target for each distinct student in ``df`` , for which
    intensity-specific time limits determine if graduation is "on-time"; null values
    are assigned when target can't be computed based on the time spanned in the dataset.

    Args:
        df: Student-term dataset.
        intensity_time_limits: Mapping of enrollment intensity value (e.g. "FULL-TIME")
            to the maximum number of years or terms considered to be an "on-time" graduation
            (e.g. [4.0, "year"], [12.0, "term"]), measured from the first term of enrollment
            within students' cohorts. To use the same time limit for all students,
            regardless of enrollment intensity, specify "*" as the only key.
        years_to_degree_col: Column whose values give the year of enrollment at cohort inst
            in which students *first* earned a particular degree; for example,
            "first_year_to_bachelors_at_cohort_inst" for Bachelors-seeking students.
            Note: If ``df`` has one row per student-term, it's assumed that years-to-degree
            values are the same across all rows, and we simply use the first.
        num_terms_in_year: Number of academic terms in one academic year,
            used to convert from term-based time limits to year-based time limits;
            default value assumes FALL, WINTER, SPRING, and SUMMER terms.
        max_term_rank: Maximum term rank value in the full dataset ``df`` , either inferred
            from ``df[term_rank_col]`` itself or as a manually specified value which
            may be different from the actual max value in ``df`` , depending on use case.
        student_id_cols: One or multiple columns uniquely identifying students.
        enrollment_intensity_col: Column whose values give students' "enrollment intensity"
            (usually either "FULL-TIME" or "PART-TIME"), for which the most common
            value per student is used when comparing against intensity-specific time limits.
        enrollment_year_col: Column whose values give students' "current" year of enrollment
            at the cohort inst as of the given row, used to filter rows to pre-graduation
            when determining students' most common enrollment intensity.
        term_is_pre_cohort_col
        term_rank_col: Column whose values give the absolute integer ranking of a given
            term within the full dataset ``df`` .
