    Get set of students in ``checkpoint`` data for which ``df`` includes

    enrollment intensity in checkpoint term, such that a target could be known for sure.

    Args:
        df: Student-term dataset.
        checkpoint: "Checkpoint" from which time limits to target term are measured,
            typically either the first enrolled term or the first term above an intermediate
            number of credits earned; may be given as a data frame with one row per student,
            or as a callable that takes ``df`` as input and returns all checkpoint terms.
        intensity_time_limits: Mapping of enrollment intensity value (e.g. "FULL-TIME")
            to the maximum number of years or terms considered to be "on-time" for
            the target number of credits earned (e.g. [4.0, "year"], [12.0, "term"]),

            terms. Passing special "*" as the only key applies the corresponding time limits
            to all students, regardless of intensity.
        max_term_rank: Maximum term rank value in the full dataset ``df`` , either inferred
            from ``df[term_rank_col]`` itself or as a manually specified value which
            may be different from the actual max value in ``df`` , depending on use case.
        num_terms_in_year: Number of academic terms in one academic year,
            used to convert from year-based time limits to term-based time limits;
            default value assumes FALL, WINTER, SPRING, and SUMMER terms.
        student_id_cols: One or multiple columns uniquely identifying students.
        enrollment_intensity_col: Column whose values give students' "enrollment intensity"
            (usually either "FULL-TIME" or "PART-TIME"), for use in applying a time limit.
        term_rank_col: Column whose values give the absolute integer ranking of a given
            term within the full dataset ``df`` .
